# Promisingness Judgments as Facilitators of Epistemic Growth and Conceptual Change

## Knowledge Building and science learning

1. A theory-building approach for deep understanding
 - “knowledge-as-theories” (Carey, 1985; Posner, et al., 1982)
 - “mental models” (Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992)
 - improvement towards higher “explanatory power” (Bereiter, 2012)
2. A community-oriented view of learning
 - individual minds → individual + social aspects (Vosniadou, 2008)
 - school as knowledge-creating organizations
 - ideas as “epistemic artifacts” to be continually improved
 
<!--in which the state of knowledge is more determined by the community rather than individuals-->

> During all those years there was the **feeling of direction**, of going straight toward something concrete. It is, of course, very hard to express that feeling in words; but it was **decidedly the case**, and clearly to be distinguished from later considerations about the rational form of the solution.

> I think, we almost felt at times that there was **almost a hand guiding us**. Because we would go from one step to the next, and somehow we would **know which was the right way to go**.

## Promisingness judgments in knowledge creation

- Paradigm shift and theory choice (Kuhn, 1977, 1996)
- Risk assessment in real-world scientific reasoning (Dunbar, 1995)
- Detecting “discrepant elements” in creative processes (Gardner, 1994)
- **Design-mode vs. belief-mode thinking** (Bereiter, 2002)
  - promisingness vs. truthfulness
- Knowledge of **promisingness** distinguishes creative experts from non-experts (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1993)

## Promisingness judgments in classrooms

- The same challenge of identifying promising directions
- An important component of students' epistemic agency
- Prior research on promisingness
  1. Promising Ideas (PI) tool in Knowledge Forum (Chen et al., 2010)
  2. The term promisingness is naturally challenging (Chen et al., 2011)
  3. With guidance, young students could make promisingness judgments leading to greater knowledge advancement (Chen et al., 2012)

## What's next?

---

## Epistemic beliefs in science learning

- "*Students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge*" (Schommer, 1990)
- Multiple dimensions (Conley, Pintrich, Vekiri, & Harrison, 2004)
  1. *certainty of knowledge*
  2. *simplicity of knowledge*
  3. *source of knowing*
  4. *justification for knowing*

## Promisingness judgments ↔ Epistemic beliefs

- Quality promisingness judgments depends on epistemic beliefs
  - knowledge is an evolving subject ↔ "certainty of knowledge"
  - ideas are complex ↔ "simplicity of knowledge"
  - ideas are tentative ↔ "justification for knowing"
- By engaging students in making promisingness judgments, whether their epistemic beliefs could be improved?

## Methods

- 26 Grade 6 students from a Colombian K-12 school
- Studying a biology unit, "popolation dymanics", for 10 weeks
