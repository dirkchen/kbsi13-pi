## Knowledge Building and science learning

1. A theory-building approach for deep understanding
> - “knowledge-as-theories” perspective (Carey, 1985; Posner, et al., 1982)
> - “mental models” (Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992)
> - continual improvement of ideas to improve their “explanatory power” (Bereiter, 2012)

2. A community-oriented view of learning
> - individual minds --> both individual and social aspects (Vosniadou, 2008)
> - school as knowledge-creating organizations, in which the state of knowledge is more determined by the community rather than individuals (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006)
> - ideas as “epistemic artifacts” to be publicly shared and continually improved

> During all those years there was the feeling of direction, of going straight toward something concrete. It is, of course, very hard to express that feeling in words; but it was decidedly the case, and clearly to be distinguished from later considerations about the rational form of the solution.
>
> ---Albert Einstein

> I think, we almost felt at times that there was almost a hand guiding us. Because we would go from one step to the next, and somehow we would know which was the right way to go.

## Promisingness judgments in creation

- Paradigm shift and theory choice (Kuhn, 1977, 1996)
- Risk assessment in real-world scientific reasoning (Dunbar, 1995)
- Detecting “discrepant elements” in creative processes (Gardner, 1994)
- Design-mode vs. belief-mode thinking (Bereiter, 2002)
  - promisingness vs. truthfulness
- Knowledge of *promisingness* distinguishes creative experts from non-experts (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1993)

## Promisingness judgments in classrooms

- The same challenge of identifying promising directions to avoid wasting time or becoming entrapped by unpromising ones
- Promisingness judgments as an important component of epistemic agency and collective cognitive responsibility
- Prior research
  - Promising Ideas (PI) tool in Knowledge Forum (Chen et al., 2010)
  - The term promisingness is naturally challenging (Chen et al., 2011)
  - With guidance, young students could make promisingness judgments leading to greater knowledge advancement (Chen et al., 2012)
- Next question
  - Is there any other latent benefit of promisingness judgments?

## Epistemic beliefs in science learning

- Definition: ...
- Rich literature (e.g., Perry, 1970; Schommer, 1990; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997)
- Conley, Pintrich, Vekiri, & Harrison, 2004
  - certainty of knowledge
  - simplicity of knowledge
  - source of knowing
  - justification for knowing
- Link with promisingness
  - quality promisingness judgments require advanced epistemic beliefs
    - one premise of promisingness is that ideas are complex and tentative; linked to "certain knowledge"
    - see knowledge as an evolving and changing subject; link to "justifying of knowledge"
  - whether by engaging students in making promisingness judgments their epistemological thinking could be improved?

## Methods

- 26 Grade 6 students from a Colombian K-12 school
- Studying a biology unit, "popolation dymanics", for 10 weeks
